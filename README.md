# Awesome Books (ES6 version)
This project is a simple library management system.
Its purpose is to show ES6 functionalities, especially JS modules.
It was built in an Ubuntu 20.04 + VS Code 1.65.2 environment + a lot of imagination and hard work.
Teamwork was also an essential tool to make things happen, so thank you to all my coding partners who worked with me so far.
